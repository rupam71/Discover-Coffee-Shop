All Front-End Rendering Technique

1. Static Site Generation (SSG) ==>   getStaticProps()
    Allows to generate html file at build time.
    Store it to CDN.
    ({ preRender })

2. Incrimental Site Generation (ISG) ==>   getStaticProps() with revalidate
    Allows to generate html file at a specific interval.
    
2. Server Site Rendering (SSR) ==>   getServersideProps() with revalidate
    New Html file generate for every request.
    Slower and less performance...

## getStaticProps() Rules
1. It should be a page file. export from page file.
2. Runs in Built time only
3. getStaticProps is a server side stuff. It will not show in browser console or devtool source.

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      coffeStore : coffeStore,
      // Send coffeStore value as props name coffeStore
    }
  }
}

export default function Home(props) {
  props.coffeStore 
  // use this to preRender
}

## getStaticPaths() for dynamic route
Its allow us to define a list of path to render in html at build time.
Runs on build time.
Also run in server-side.

1. It should be a page file. export from page file.
2. Only for dynamic paths/route.
3. Page must also implement getStaticProps().
